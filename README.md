# My Customizable UI Discord Application

This is a sample application that uses NextAuth and the Discord API to authenticate users and interact with the Discord platform.

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to create a new application in the Discord Developer Portal and get your client ID and client secret. Once you have those, you can use them to configure the Discord provider in the `next-auth.config.js` file.

You will also need to configure your redirect URL in the Discord Developer Portal. This is the URL that the user will be redirected to after they have granted or denied permission to your application.

## Running the Application

To run the application, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Once you have those, you can run the following commands in your project's directory:

```
npm install
```

```
npm run dev
```

This will install the necessary dependencies and start the development server. You can then access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Deploying the Application

When deploying the application to a production environment, you will need to use a valid domain name as the redirect URL. You should also use a proper domain name and SSL certificate to protect your users' data when you deploy your application to production.

## Terms of Service

By using this application, you agree to abide by the terms of service of the Discord API and the Discord Developer Portal. These terms can be found on the Discord Developer Portal at https://discord.com/developers/docs/legal.

## Disclaimer

This is just an example, you should always read the official documentation and understand the terms of service of the Discord API before building a production application.

Please make sure to follow the Discord developer guidelines and terms of service when building your application, and also to keep your client secret safe, as it allows access to your application's data and interactions.
